# React Weather App

This application utillizes the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API to display weather stats for any city you search for via name or valid US zip code. Also, if you have your location sharing on in your browswer settings, then it will automatically display the weather data for your location on page load.
